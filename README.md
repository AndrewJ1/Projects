## Introduction
For this project, you will be acting as a consultant for a fictional real-estate investment firm. The firm has asked you what seems like a simple question:

what are the top 5 best zipcodes for us to invest in?

This may seem like a simple question at first glance, but there's more than a little ambiguity here that you'll have to think through in order to provide a solid recommendation. Should your recommendation be focused on profit margins only? What about risk? What sort of time horizon are you predicting against? Your recommendation will need to detail your rationale and answer any sort of lingering questions like these in order to demonstrate how you define "best".

As mentioned previously, the data you'll be working with comes from the Zillow Research Page. However, there are many options on that page, and making sure you have exactly what you need can be a bit confusing. For simplicity's sake, we have already provided the dataset for you in this repo--you will find it in the file zillow_data.csv.

## The Deliverables
The goal of this project is to have you complete a very common real-world task in regard to Time-Series Modeling. However, real world problems often come with a significant degree of ambiguity, which requires you to use your knowledge of statistics and data science to think critically about and answer. While the main task in this project is Time-Series Modeling, that isn't the overall goal--it is important to understand that Time-Series Modeling is a tool in your toolbox, and the forecasts it provides you are what you'll use to answer important questions.

In short, to pass this project, demonstrating the quality and thoughtfulness of your overall recommendation is at least as important as successfully building a Time-Series model!

Online students should complete the following 4 deliverables for this project:

A well-documented Jupyter Notebook containing any code you've written for this project (use the notebook in this repo, mod_4_starter_notebook.ipynb). This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.
An organized README.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.
A Blog post.
An 'Executive Summary' PowerPoint Presentation that explains your rationale and methodology for determining the best zipcodes for investment.
